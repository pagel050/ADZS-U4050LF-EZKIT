         Analog Devices, Inc. ADuCM4050 Application Example

Project Name: Readme_LED_button_callback.

Description:  Use the GPIO driver to Toggle LED's when the push buttons are 
              pressed on the ADuCM4050 EZ-Kit.
              
Overview:
=========
    This example uses the GPIO driver to configure the push buttons (GPIO input)
    and LED's (GPIO output) on the ADuCM4050 EZ-Kit.  An interrupt is generated by
    the push buttons which executes a callback to toggle the LED's.Pressing PB1 toggles
    LED-4 while PB2 toggles LED-5.

User Configuration Macros:
==========================
    None.
    
Hardware Setup:
===============
    ADuCM4050-EZ-Kit should be configured with default settings jumper 
    settings. Please refer ADuCM4050 EZ-Kit Manual for default 
    jumper settings.

External connections:
=====================
    None.

How to build and run:
=====================    
    Prepare hardware as explained in the Hardware Setup section.
    Build the project, load the executable to ADuCM4050, and run it.

Expected Result:
=================        
    Press PB1 or PB2 to toggle LED4 and LED5 on the ADuCM4x50 EZ-Kit 
    The example waits for the button press. If no buttons are pressed, it will timeout after sometime 
	and prints "All Done!".
